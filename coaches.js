I been programming for a while now began my career programming in GW Basic and progressed to VB6/VBA MSSQL Server and other MS technologies. JavaSctipt still amazes me its such a great language because all you need to write code is notepad and you can create working apps in minutes. I joined PWJS course to learn some cool web technologies that allow us to create cool looking apps in minutes. This course and teh wonderful member community provides me the perfect paltform to hone both my programming and my soft skiils and hopefully make some money in the process. I am passionate about helping others with their coding questions becasue it not only helps me soldify my understanding about the concepts but also  learn from their mistakes.",
